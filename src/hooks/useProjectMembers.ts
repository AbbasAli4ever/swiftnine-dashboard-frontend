/**
 * The people who may be assigned to a task, or @-mentioned, in one project.
 *
 * On a PUBLIC project that's the whole workspace, exactly as before. On a
 * PRIVATE one the backend rejects any assignee who isn't a project member
 * (`USER_NOT_PROJECT_MEMBER`), so offering the full roster would let the user
 * pick someone the server then refuses — this narrows the list to match.
 *
 * PUBLIC costs no extra requests. Visibility is read from the project list
 * already in the React Query cache (`ProjectContext` holds it with a 5-minute
 * staleTime), so there's no request to *learn* the visibility, and the
 * `/members` call is skipped entirely unless the project is private.
